This is the first submission of this package to CRAN. 

Because this package requires ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop to be
installed, automated testing on e.g. Travis-CI is not possible. 
Testing is done on the local machine via the generation of the
vignettes and very basic tests of sucessful connection to ArcGIS
using package `testthat` tests. 

## Test environments
