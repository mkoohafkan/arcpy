```

Getting started with `arcpy` in R is easy. If you're using ArcGIS Pro,
you'll first need to create a Conda environment that will link to your
ArcGIS Pro install. For example, here's how you would create a Conda
environment to link to an ArcGIS Pro 3.0 install (note that ArcGIS Pro
3.0 uses Python 3.9).


```r
library(arcpy)

install_arcpy("r-arcpy", arcgis_version = "3.1", python_version = "3.9")
```

If you don't specify the python version, the package will use the
latest compatible Python version based on what is reported in the
arcpy module build.

The `arcpy` package automatically provides a `reticulate` module object 
called `arcpy`. This object provides the interface to ArcGIS.


```r
arcpy
```

```
## Module(arcpy)
```

```r
arcpy$GetInstallInfo()$ProductName
```

```
## [1] "ArcGISPro"
```

Once you are connected to your ArcGIS installation, using `arcpy` functions
and classes is as seamless as using any other Python module via `reticulate`.
The `arcpy` pacakge also re-exports reticulate's `py_help` function so that 
you can access the `arcpy` documentation.



```r
# get and set the arcpy environment
arcpy$env$workspace = tempdir()
arcpy$env$workspace

# get help on arcpy functions
py_help(arcpy$Exists)
```


```
## [1] "C:/Temp\\RtmpchsEWf"
```


Happy scripting!
